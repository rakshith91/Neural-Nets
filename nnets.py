neural networks

The program takes about 6 mins for 25 iterations. 

1) Problem description

The problem is to classify image orientation using neural networks. It involves two steps:feed forward and back propagation.

There is an input layer with 192 nodes in it, hidden layer with a user specified number of nodes and 4 output nodes in the output layer.

Each node in the previous layer is connected to all the nodes in the next layer forming a trellis. Each edge has a weight.

The weight matrix from input layer to hidden layer is called weights_one
The weight matrix from hidden layer to output layer is called weights_two

In the feed forward, the weights are generate randomly from a uniform distribution between (-1, 1).

Before running the feed forward, the data is normalised . Every value x in column C is normalised to x/max(C).

Once the hidden nodes values are computed , a sigmoid activation function is used. 

The train functions does feed forward once and backpropagation 15 times and keeps learning the weights. 

Every time, step function of 0.1 is used along with a regularization parameter of 0.01

The loss function used is 1/2(y-y_hat)**2.This shows the overall loss in training the data



2)description of program 

The transpose function returns transpose of a matrix.

normalize returns the normalized matrix.

read_data returns a tuple of data, features and image names

generate_weights generates the weight matrix 

loss_matrix compute the loss after every computation.

feed_forward function is to perform feed forward with given weights.i.e. to test the data.

finally train returns the weights tuple after training on the train data and write_to_file writes the output.

3)discussion of any problems

There are several problems faced :

i) decision of the activation function between sigmoid, tanh : sigmoid has been chosen

ii)Due to high bias, all the examples are getting classified to either 90 or 180.
